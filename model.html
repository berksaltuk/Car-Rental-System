            This proposal is for our database management system project which is about implementing a web-based Car Rental System. This proposal will contain a brief description of our application, establish functional and non-functional requirements, mention limitations, restrictions the technologies which we will be using while implementing the application. At the end of the proposal we will propose an E/R model for our database system. This system will be used by both the company’s employees and their customers.

            Objective

        <p class = "first-text">
            In our database system project, we are going to implement a web-based Car Rental System which will imitate a real life car rental system.  While implementing our database and our application layer we intend to use the best practices followed by many other developers around the world. Implemented system will be used by both the company's employees and the customers. The main goals of this web-based system are as follows:
          </p>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class = "first-text">To offer our customers an easy to use car rental service where they can choose from a wide range of options.</li>
            <li class = "first-text">To offer our customers different branches that they can rent cars suitable for their taste and driving experience.</li>
            <li class = "first-text">To offer customers an easy renting experience with an easy to use UI, online payment with flexible return and pick-up locations.</li>
            <li class = "first-text">To improve the system and customers experience,  a review system where each customer can give feedback about their rental experience. </li>
            <li class = "first-text">To offer  employees an easy to use management platform where they can manage their daily tasks.</li>
            <li class = "first-text">To offer an easy monitoring system for reservations such as monitoring ending and starting dates, and charge a penalty for excess time and for damage of cars if needed.</li>
            <li class = "first-text">To help managers to hire new employees from the job offerings section, and buy new cars by adding them to the database.</li>
